		It is used to represnet conversion ratio/rate each value is dependent on the previous value
		(+ve or -ve).

23. Table: 
		using table we can show more no. of KPI important value all together.
		additionally we can apply conditional formatting in table value. using insights more effectively.

24. Matrix: enhanced table/more readable.
		matrix visual also works similairty like table visual we can add more cataegories,	
		we can avoid scrolling bar in matrix value.

25. Waterfall chart: 
		it is used for break down analysis.	Above waterfall is showing total sales in each 	individual 
		year and increase(or) decrease sales of a particular category between years.

26. Gauge Chart: 
		with measure and without measure using gauge chart we can set key number as a target and can check 
		the results according to target.

27. KPI: 
		KPI chart is similar to gauge chart.
		using KPI we can represent the % of Gain/Losses in the target for that particular period.
		how much you achieved, how much have to achieve, ETC.

28. Decomposition tree: 
		We can use the decomposition tree to visualize data in multiple dimensions. We can drill down
		and analyze data in the hierarchy for a quick analysis. Itsâ€™s artificial intelligence (AI) 
		capability enables you to find the next dimension data as per defined criteria. We breakdown
		(decompose) data into individual categories and determine the high,low values using
		AI functions in this decomposition visual.	

29. Tree map chat: 
		tree map chart will reperent the data in a rectangular shape. the big in size of the
		particular rectangle represents the more value. the big size the more sales.

30. Key influencer charts:
		comes under AI chart. it will reads the scenario and give the influeing factors.
		not sure either values are perfect (or) not. not preferable. wont use much in real time.

#Custom charts/visuals:

31. Animated bar chart: 
		works similarity bar chart.
		there are some drawbacks with this chart, as was not certified/verified by microsoft.
		we cant change bar colors we cant change axis values range.

32. Word cloud: 
		word cloud will work similar to tree map. The bigger letter size the more size.
		in tree map, if there is more no. of categories then will loose readability, to overcome that we
		can use word cloud chart. word cloud is suitable when we have more no. of categories values.	

33. Drill Through and pie chart: 
		using this chart we can show more no. of categoricalvalues.
		we can get more information by given Drill Through we can enable also.

35. scroller: 
		similar to scrolling headlines.

		using sankey chart, we can compare the difference between one categoricalvalues and another 
		categoricalvalues flow between two categories we can reperent.
		
37. Radar Chart/spider web: 
		we can show focus points using radar chart/spider web.
		
38. Text filters: 
		we can say text filters is an advanced slicer.
		but searching in text filter. the word directly will get filtered in Table/Matrix.
	
39. Tornado Chart: 
		to compare between two categories.
		using slicer we can filter and check required fields.
	
40. Sunburst chart: 
		to represent hierarchy data we can use this chart.
		if more cataegories it is not that readable.
	
41. Advanced card:	
        it is similar to card visual, with conditionla formatting
	
42. Chiclet slicer:	
		similar to slice.
		it provider image functinality.
		multiple field we can select without clicking 'Ctrl'
	
43. Stacked column chart: 
		similar to in built stackked column chart.	using this chart we can select multiple categories by 
		simply dragging on that particular column without clicking ctrl.
	
44. Enlighten Aquarium: 
		The more sales the bigger Fish.
		
45. Hierachy slicer:
        A Power BI hierarchy slicer allows you to filter information based on hierarchical filters, just as you can use slicers on numerical data.
 
46. Calender of Tallan:
        Visual offers an exciting way to display and filter date related data. View the aggregation of data across a range of dates in a standard calendar layout.

47. Funnel Pyramid:
